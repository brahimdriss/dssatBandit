# DssatBandit

The code in this repository is a modified copy of "Optimal Thompson Sampling strategies for support-aware CVaR bandits 2021 ICML".
You can check [the main repository](https://github.com/rgautron/DssatBanditEnv) for the original code and additional informations.

The purpose of this repository is to use the code without the constraints of rerunning all the computations, by adding the option to load precalculated values for a fixed setup.
You can try the code in the following [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D2XmfItJjgeHp236n0rgGE0n6ymigyuC?usp=sharing).
